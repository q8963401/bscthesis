\begin_layout Part
Of How Our Hero Came and Went
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Coming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero came in.
 He was tired.
 He thought the world belonged to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Meeting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero met with Laurinda.
 She was smiling.
 But our hero was not amused.
 His whiskers were dripping wet, he was astonishingly thirsty, and the contradic
tion was killing him.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But Wenceslau, you don't belong here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 What a stupid thing to say at that precise moment, our hero thought to
 himself.
 Only that it came out loud.
 At that precise moment he knew that the desired beer would not be forthcoming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned to the bartender and tried to obtain a beer by the very old method
 of purchasing it.
 But being ignored was not one of Laurinda's specialities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Going
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could not last.
 Laurinda's hips were flapping, and she was hopping mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Our Hero's Imagination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero imagined her as a rabbit with long ears and a fine set of tusks.
 In a short time the image drifted to a walrus, and our hero could not help
 letting his sinister smile giving him away.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Laurinda's Anger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wasn't it great
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said Laurinda.
 Actually she said it in the present tense, but our poor storytelling skills
 have changed that to a cheesy past.
 Don't do this at home, kids.
 You want to be regarded for your authenticity, and misquoting isn't going
 to help much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, back to the story.
 Laurinda wanted to hit him in the head with a big ham that she kept just
 for occassions like this, and being a solid Hitchcock fan she was ready
 to cook the ham afterwards and serve the resulting stew to any policemen
 that might come by.
 She was also a huge Almod칩var fan, but she was unaware that in an early
 film the divine Pedro had copied the scene.
 Actually both directors had copied the idea from a short story by Roald
 Dahl, very much worth reading.
 Although it must be said that in this story it was a lamb leg, which hardly
 offers the consistency and stiffness necessary to kill a sturdy husband.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But who cares.
 Laurinda meanwhile had a funny appearance; if you want to see why please
 direct your eyes to figure

\begin_layout Section
The Passing Away
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero was passing by the village.
 He had only stopped to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Again here our lousy skills have made us spoil the quote, but this time
 for the opposite reasons: everyone knows how to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so we don't need an actual quote.
 It is enough to report that the had stopped to say hi, even maybe qualifying
 it a bit to make do for the missing exclamation sign: he could have stopped
 to say a friendly hi.
 Getting all literary he could have stopped to say a longing hi, although
 this road leads to bizarreness.
 It could be cool though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But anyway.
 Laurinda was so mad, so hopping mad that she called her friend, the Assassin.
 He was not in town at that precise moment, but that didn't help our hero
 as he was just outside town killing people in a small barn.
 Just for practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero left the village, but Laurinda cunningly annotated the MAC address
 of his laptop's wifi card.
 The lack of networking knowledge on the part of our hero (who really couldn't
 tell a SYN packet from an ACK) was to play an important part in the story
 -- if he had known how to change the MAC address, which identified him
 with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel, he would have been safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's not even get into that last scalpel metaphor, shall we not? It leaks
 worse than the Titanic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
Of How Our Hero Went No More
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Killing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero led a happy existence for a long time afterwards, randomly avoiding
 all points within connecting distance of a wifi network.
 It could not last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero went to the next village, found a friendly Moonrams cafe and connected
 to the net.
 Quickly the assassin (who knew the very people that run the internet, and
 who by this display of nerdiness no longer merits the starting capital
 letter) traced a bunch of IP packets coming from our hero's MAC address.
 He deployed a team of murderous African bees, which as surely as a well-cared-f
or AK-47 reached our hero and killed him with three fast stings.
 Of course they died afterwards, being bees and all, so it was an astounding
 feat this training of wild African bees just for this one murder.
 Maybe the Assassin merits that capital letter after all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Passing Away
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero was undone.
 He was no more.
 He was, actually, an ex-hero.
